## 🔐 Data Collection & Storage

### 1. Local Storage Only
All the data you enter in the app—including your kilometers, fuel usage, income records, expenses, photos, and vehicle details—is **stored only on your device**.  
The app does **not transmit, upload, or share any of your data to external servers or third-party services** at this time.

### 2. No Internet Required
Fleet Logbook works completely offline. There is currently **no cloud sync** or remote backup feature implemented. Your data remains private and under your control on your phone.

## 📸 Photo Attachments

You may optionally attach photos to your records (e.g., fuel receipts or ride proofs). These images are saved locally on your device and are **not shared** or uploaded anywhere.

## 🔐 Security

We take your privacy seriously:
- All data is stored securely in your phone’s internal storage or local database.
- The app does not collect or access any data unless you explicitly enter it.
- No background tracking or location data is collected.

## 🧑‍💻 Permissions

To function properly, the app may request the following **optional permissions**:
- **Storage/Media** (to attach and store photos related to your records)

We do not access your photos, files, or device data without your permission.
